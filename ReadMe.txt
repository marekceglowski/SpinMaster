SpinMaster Readme

This is just a fun little OpenGL project I was doing for my Computer Graphics class. It ended up looking really cool so I thought I'd upload it on GitHub for myself. I can't get the portable executable to work on its own unfortunately (dependancy issues -- I tried fixing it to no avail) but if you open the files into a C++ IDE you should be able build/compile it yourself.

I used Code:Blocks as my IDE with FreeGlut set up.
Commands are in the COMMANDS.txt document, or just check the console when running the program.

Enjoy!
